# Decisoes:

## Quais stocks usar?
- Filtrar ações com base em critérios como liquidez, desempenho histórico ou previsões de retorno.
- eliminar ações com baixa liquidez ou alto ruído
- Limitar o número de ações (50 ou 100 ativos deve ser bom)

## Como lidar com anomalias (tipo covid)

## Que features usar?
- usar a diferença de preços de cada dia?
- wavelet transform
- rolling avg (para a tendencia e talvez racio com o close price) em varias janelas - n vi em nenhum paper mas parece fazer sentido
- vamos considerar dividendos no cálculo do retorno total do portfólio? Se não, acho que podemos excluir "Dividends"
- será que "Stock Splits" é relevante? Usar os splits como um possível indicador, como data de referência para mudanças no comportamento do preço
- macroeconomic variables
- preço do dolar/euro/etc


## Como vai ser a previsao?
- que modelos usar? Random forest regressor VS SVR VS XGBoost VS LSTM VS etc - lembrar de nao usar 2 algoritmos em arvore
- em vez de prever o open e close prices prever a variação (open - close) - isto foi invensão do Pedro (escrevi mais em baixo)
- classificação (se sobe ou desce) VS regressão (quanto sobe e desce)
- prever varios dias de uma vez ou só um dia à frente (um dia parece melhor?)
- para um dia de cada vez o dia 2 pode usar o verdadeiro valor do dia 1? (acho que não)

## Métricas de Avaliação previsão:
- Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
- correlation coefficient (R)
- Theil’s inequality coefficient (Theil U)


## Otimização do portfolio
- monte-carlo VS genetico VS Modelo de Markowitz
- Markowitz deve ser o mais simples mas não é "machine learning" 


### Para Modelo de Markowitz
- Aplique métodos robustos para estimativa de entradas, como shrinkage ou otimização bayesiana
- Em vez de minimizar apenas o risco (variância), utilize métricas como o Sharpe Ratio (retorno ajustado ao risco) para balancear melhor risco e retorno em horizontes curtos
- Considere incluir ativos com alta liquidez ou estratégias de hedge para proteger o portfólio contra movimentos bruscos no curto prazo
- Limite a alocação máxima em qualquer ativo a 10% para evitar concentração excessiva

## Métricas de Avaliação portfolio
- Sharpe Ratio: Retorno ajustado ao risco.
- Cumulative Return: Retorno acumulado ao longo do tempo.
- Drawdown: Perda máxima observada

WT(wavelet) is considered to fix the noise feature of financial time series. It is a widely used technique for filtering and mining single-dimensional signals [23–25].

For each stock index, three types of variables are used as model inputs. The first set is historical stock trading data, such as the Open, High, Low and Close price (OHLC) [26–28], and the second is the technical indicators of stock trading. These are commonly used inputs in previous studies [29]. Apart from these, we also introduce the macroeconomic variables as the third type of inputs. As the macro economy can hugely influence stock markets and the advantage of our deep learning model is the ability to extract abstract and invariant features from input variables[30, 31], we believe the addition of macroeconomic variables could improve the model performance.

we evaluate the model’s performance from two dimensions: predictive accuracy and profitability. The predictive accuracy is evaluated by using three measurements: Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), correlation coefficient (R) and Theil’s inequality coefficient (Theil U)

Log Returns:
- Instead of raw differences, you could use the log return: log⁡(P_t/P_(t−1)).
- Advantages: Log returns are scale-independent, and their distribution is closer to normal, which is useful for many statistical and machine learning models.

Para otimização do portfolio:
- Mean-Variance Optimization (Modelo de Markowitz) - n sei se é considerado IA
TODO: heurísticas de busca para restrições adicionais

1. Introduction to Monte Carlo Methods (Pages 1-20)

    Purpose: Monte Carlo (MC) methods are used for simulating complex systems that involve randomness, such as stock price movements. This is particularly useful in finance, where asset prices and market behaviors are influenced by numerous unpredictable factors.
    Why We Use It: MC methods allow us to generate a large number of possible outcomes based on the probabilistic behavior of the market, helping us model the uncertainty in financial predictions. By simulating many scenarios, we can better understand the range of possible outcomes and their probabilities, which is valuable for making informed investment decisions.
    Financial Application: In finance, MC simulations are widely used to predict asset prices, evaluate the probability of reaching certain profit or loss levels, and assess risk in a controlled, quantifiable way.

2. Monte Carlo Simulation for Financial Forecasting (Pages 103-130)

    Purpose: This section covers how MC simulations can be used specifically to simulate stock price paths over time. Typically, prices are assumed to follow a stochastic process like Geometric Brownian Motion, where future prices depend on current prices and have a random component.
    Why We Use It: Stock prices are influenced by a combination of historical trends, volatility, and unpredictable market shocks. MC simulation allows us to model these price movements by generating multiple possible "futures" for each stock. The randomness in these simulations reflects market uncertainties.
    Financial Application: In forecasting stock prices, this approach helps in estimating a range of likely future prices, which is crucial when setting up an investment portfolio. By examining many simulated price paths, investors can see probable price fluctuations, helping them prepare for different market conditions and adjust their strategies accordingly.

3. Variance Reduction Techniques (Pages 171-218)

    Purpose: MC simulations can require vast numbers of simulations to achieve accurate results, which is computationally expensive. Variance reduction techniques aim to make the simulation process more efficient by reducing the "noise" (variance) in our predictions without needing more simulations.
    Why We Use It: Using these techniques, such as control variates and antithetic variates, helps increase the accuracy of our results while keeping the computational cost manageable. This is especially important in finance, where high-frequency simulations may be needed.
    Financial Application: For example, in portfolio optimization, you might be interested in simulating different stock price scenarios to balance expected returns with risk. By applying variance reduction, you get more stable results that can lead to better portfolio decisions without requiring excessive computational resources.

4. Risk Assessment and Portfolio Optimization (Pages 339-373)

    Purpose: Monte Carlo methods allow for a probabilistic evaluation of risk, using metrics like Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). These metrics quantify the potential loss in a portfolio over a certain period, given a specified confidence level.
    Why We Use It: Assessing risk is fundamental in portfolio management, as investors want to understand potential losses under adverse market conditions. MC methods enable the simulation of a wide variety of market scenarios, including rare but extreme events, helping to gauge the portfolio’s vulnerability to these risks.
    Financial Application: In your project, portfolio optimization involves selecting stocks to maximize returns and minimize risk. Monte Carlo can simulate the combined performance of a portfolio across various market conditions, providing insights into the potential downside (risk) of each portfolio configuration, which helps in creating a balanced investment strategy.

5. Advanced Topics in Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods (Pages 241-270)

    Purpose: Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques are an alternative to standard MC simulations, using sequences that are more evenly distributed across the possible outcomes, leading to potentially faster convergence in high-dimensional problems.
    Why We Use It: QMC methods are particularly useful when you’re dealing with complex problems, like portfolio optimization, that involve numerous stocks and require a high-dimensional simulation. QMC can often achieve similar accuracy to MC but with fewer simulations, which is helpful for high-dimensional tasks.
    Financial Application: In optimizing a stock portfolio, you may need to simulate numerous possible stock price paths, especially with a large portfolio. QMC can reduce the time and resources needed for these simulations, making it feasible to handle a more complex portfolio with many assets efficiently.

6. Path-Dependent and American Options (Pages 391-430)

    Purpose: Although this section is focused on options pricing, the idea of path dependency is valuable in financial forecasting, as the outcome depends on the entire sequence of events (i.e., the stock’s price path) rather than just its final value.
    Why We Use It: In time-series analysis, like forecasting stock prices, path dependency reflects real-world scenarios where future prices are influenced by past trends. Understanding path-dependent dynamics helps in creating models that account for cumulative effects over time.
    Financial Application: Even though your project may not involve options, the concept of path dependency is relevant. For instance, stock forecasts might rely on past price data patterns, not just recent data. This section’s approach to handling complex dependencies can help improve your forecasting model’s realism and responsiveness to historical patterns.
