WT(wavelet) is considered to fix the noise feature of financial time series. It is a widely used technique for filtering and mining single-dimensional signals [23–25].

For each stock index, three types of variables are used as model inputs. The first set is historical stock trading data, such as the Open, High, Low and Close price (OHLC) [26–28], and the second is the technical indicators of stock trading. These are commonly used inputs in previous studies [29]. Apart from these, we also introduce the macroeconomic variables as the third type of inputs. As the macro economy can hugely influence stock markets and the advantage of our deep learning model is the ability to extract abstract and invariant features from input variables[30, 31], we believe the addition of macroeconomic variables could improve the model performance.

we evaluate the model’s performance from two dimensions: predictive accuracy and profitability. The predictive accuracy is evaluated by using three measurements: Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), correlation coefficient (R) and Theil’s inequality coefficient (Theil U)
