WT(wavelet) is considered to fix the noise feature of financial time series. It is a widely used technique for filtering and mining single-dimensional signals [23–25].

For each stock index, three types of variables are used as model inputs. The first set is historical stock trading data, such as the Open, High, Low and Close price (OHLC) [26–28], and the second is the technical indicators of stock trading. These are commonly used inputs in previous studies [29]. Apart from these, we also introduce the macroeconomic variables as the third type of inputs. As the macro economy can hugely influence stock markets and the advantage of our deep learning model is the ability to extract abstract and invariant features from input variables[30, 31], we believe the addition of macroeconomic variables could improve the model performance.

we evaluate the model’s performance from two dimensions: predictive accuracy and profitability. The predictive accuracy is evaluated by using three measurements: Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), correlation coefficient (R) and Theil’s inequality coefficient (Theil U)

    The multiobjective hybrid genetic algorithm:  is a specific type of computational approach that uses 
                                                    genetic algorithms—a type of algorithm inspired by 
                                                    natural selection.
                                                    The "multiobjective" part indicates that it tries to optimize
                                                    multiple goals at once, while "hybrid" implies it combines 
                                                    different methods or techniques to improve its performance.

                                                  mohGA aims to maintain a diverse set of solutions, 
                                                  offering different trade-offs across objectives. 
                                                  This way, decision-makers can choose the best solution 
                                                  based on their priorities

                                                  combines genetic algorithms with other optimization techniques


                                                  optimizing for multiple goals simultaneously, 
                                                  such as maximizing returns, 
                                                  minimizing risk, 
                                                  and improving prediction accuracy



    particularly useful for fields that require strategic resource planning and optimization
