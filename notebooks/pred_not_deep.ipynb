    "When determining the optimal training size for time series forecasting, a key consideration is the balance between the amount of historical data and the ability of the model to generalize effectively. Commonly, a \"window size\" is chosen, which refers to the number of past observations used to train a model before predicting future points. Research suggests that for time series data, particularly in volatile and unpredictable contexts, using a larger window (e.g., 70% of the data) can improve model performance as it captures enough historical context, but care must be taken to avoid overfitting to past patterns. For example, one approach using a sliding window technique with a 70% training size has been applied successfully, where data is divided into a training set and a test set based on this proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, some studies suggest that using cross-validation methods like Time Series Split or Sliding Window cross-validation can provide better insights into model performance across different segments of the data. These methods test the model on multiple, time-sensitive segments and can help determine whether increasing the training size (or adjusting the window) consistently leads to improved predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of practical implementation, experimenting with different window sizes (e.g., 60%, 70%, 80%) and horizons (e.g., predicting 5-day or 10-day ahead) is advised. Testing this across multiple time periods can also help ensure robustness, especially for volatile financial markets or stock prices."
